      <h2>Here's a little info about myself</h2>

        <p>
          I was a truck driver for 8 years until heal issues made it impossible to continue. I tried out a job working
          at Carrier (the AC company) but the culture there was toxic. Then I tried being a work from home call center
          represenative but figure out pretty quickly that
          wasn't the carrer path for me.

        <h2>The main topic: My Computer building hobby</h2>
        <p>
          My main hobby has always building computers. I had an early interest in programming but lacked the modivation
          to persue it. Hardware was much more accessable in terms of learning for me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Below is a picture of my current computer. It's performance sits on the "enthusiast" end of the spectrum.
