      <h1>Welcome to my Website!</h1>

      <h2>Here's a little info about myself</h2>

        <p>
          I was a truck driver for 8 years until heal issues made it impossible to continue. I tried out a job working
          at Carrier (the AC company) but the culture there was toxic. Then I tried being a work from home call center
          represenative but figured out pretty quickly that
          wasn't the carrer path for me.
        </p>
        <h2>The main topic: My Computer building hobby</h2>
        <p>
          My main hobby has always building computers. I had an early interest in programming but lacked the modivation
          to persue it. Hardware was much more accessable in terms of learning for me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Below is a picture of my current computer. It's performance sits on the "enthusiast" end of the spectrum.
        </p>

      <h2>Non-exhaustive list of specs</h2>
      <p>
        The case is a Core P5 from Thermaltake with cooling from Corsair. The CPU is an Intel i9 12900KF backed by
        32GB of DDR5 ram. An EVGA 3080 provides 3D graphics prosessing.

      <h3>Updates!</h3>
      <p>Fixed some issues which allowed users to post HTML into page2 (Guestbook). Now it just removes any '<' or '>' which pretty much breaks any HTML.</p>
      <p>I've been working on various improvements to the server code. Up until now if a client tried to send a .XML to my server, it'd just crash outright. That /should/ be fixed now. </p>
      <p>Note: Haven't made a 404 page so far so if you do something the server doesn't like, it 404's then gives you the home page. Didn't want to flashbang anyone with a stark white 404 screen.</p>
      <p>Fixed JSON submission. If the wrong keys are used or no keys are present, it'll just sign with 'not provided' in the missing/incorrect fields</p>
